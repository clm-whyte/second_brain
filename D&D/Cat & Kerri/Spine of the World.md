# Spine of the World
Fyriah is an Established Ranger with little world experience outside of the rangers.

Malevira is a Blood Hunter hunting monsters for coin.

> To the farthest northern reaches of Faerun lies a vast mountain range known as the Spine of the World. It stretches from the Trackless Sea in the West all the way to the High Ice in the east.

> During the summer months, the region is filled with a diverse range of flora and fauna. The residents of nearby Ten Towns grow fat from an abundance of good food and good trade with nearby cities of Luskan and Mirabar.

> Winter, however, is a wholly different story. Winter is harsh. The mountain passes are filled with snow. The paths are treacherous, avalanches are common, and the beasts are hungry and desperate. Only the hardy (or foolhardy) would attempt strike a living in the mountains during the freeze.

> As Winter relents to Spring, that's where we spot three figures limping through the thawing passes. The Rangers of the Spine, hired to ensure some relative safety through the trade routes, are making their way back to Luskan to collect some coin and some well-deserved rest.

> A half Orc is being suported on either side as he clutches a wound at his side.

> Marco: You can stop your arguing Cavil, we've done the lion's share of work. And you're in no fit state to go chasing wolves. 

> Cavil: Urgh, I'd have gotten it clean if  over here knew how to set a trap properly, no offence kiddo.

> Marco: Well that's interesting.
> Cavil: What is it?
> Marco: There's someone down there who's either dumber or more desperate than we are. They're trekking solo up through the ravine.
> Cavil: They look like they're struggling.
> Marco: No more than we are, if we stop for another passenger there's no guarantee we'll make it back to Luskan before nightfall.
